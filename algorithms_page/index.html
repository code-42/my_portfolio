Mission #1
Create and upload a text file that contains a two or three sentence summary of two or three famous algorithms AND include your personal thoughts on why it's important AND why you selected to submit this algorithm. The text document should follow the following format:

Submission #1
A. Algortithm Name: Hashing Algorithm 
B. Summary: A hashing algorithm is a function that produces a string that can be used to uniquely identify it. 
C. Historical importance/Impact: It can be used for finding duplicate data, protecting data, and is used in cryptography.
D. Selection Rationale:  I selected to submit this algorithm because I will be seeing a lot of it in my programming career.  I need to get to know this algorithm well.   


Submission #2
A. Algortithm Name:  Binary search
B. Summary: A technique for finding a particular value by ruling out half of the data at each step.  A binary search algorithm works by determining if it is equal to, less than, or greater than the value for which youâ€™re searching.
C. Historical importance/Impact: A binary search has an efficiency of Big O(log n) while a linear search has an efficiency of O(n).  That's not as bad as O(N^2) or O(N^3).
D. Selection Rationale: I selected to submit this algorithm because I understand it and I can explain it.  


Submission #3
A. Algortithm Name:  Euclid's Algorithm
B. Summary: An efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.  It
C. Historical importance/Impact:  It is one of the oldest algorithms in common use and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations.  
D. Selection Rationale:  I selected to submit this algorithm because it's in every math book and website I've ever seen, and is applied to a wide variety of calculations.

Mastering recursion is one of the key steps on your path to becoming a computer scientist.

Merge Sort is pretty fast
We can use that technique along with recursion to come up with a sorting algorithm called "Merge Sort".

Heap Sort
Has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case O(n log n) runtime.
